# WAR — Context

The ubiquitous language of WAR (Work · Audit · Refine), a Claude-native orchestration of
worker/auditor/refiner agents over git worktrees and GitHub issues. This file is a glossary
only — no implementation detail.

## Language

### Worktree provisioning

**Provisioning**:
The owned lifecycle of the git topology a WAR run executes in: cutting the integration branch,
creating each task's worktree on the correct base, scoping it, reusing it for fixes, and tearing
it down (or preserving it on escalation).
_Avoid_: setup, bootstrapping, worktree management.

**Git-topology owner**:
The single role responsible for every mutation of *shared* git state — branches and worktree
directories. In WAR this is the refiner (the Refinery).
_Avoid_: provisioner (no separate role exists), branch manager.

**Container** / **Contents**:
The boundary between what the git-topology owner controls and what a worker controls. The
*container* is the branch and worktree directory (refiner-owned); the *contents* are the files
and commits inside a worktree (worker-owned). A worker never runs `git worktree add/remove` or
touches a shared branch; the refiner never edits task code.

**Task worktree**:
The one git worktree assigned to a single task, where its worker (and any later fix-worker)
implements that task. One per task, persisting until the task lands.
_Avoid_: checkout, sandbox, workspace.

**Integration branch**:
The per-phase branch (`integration/<plan-slug>/phase-N`, plan-namespaced so concurrent runs don't
collide) cut off the working branch, from which all of that phase's task worktrees are created and
into which approved tasks are merged. Removed after the phase lands.
_Avoid_: feature branch, phase branch, staging branch.

### Repo-derived provisioning (Part B)

**Provision list** (`run.provision`):
The ordered, pinned shell commands that take a bare worktree from checkout to **gate-ready**, derived
from the target repo's *own* declared setup. Run verbatim, in order, before the gate.
_Avoid_: setup script, bootstrap steps, install commands.

**Setup-scout**:
The read-only agent that derives the provision list from the target repo's signals, in descending
authority (explicit → CI → dev-onboarding → structural floor). Holds no ecosystem knowledge itself.
_Avoid_: detector, provisioner, bootstrapper.

**`env-blocked`**:
The task outcome when a provision step fails: the worktree is not gate-ready, the worker is **never
spawned**, and the Lead escalates with **zero FIX rounds**. Distinct from a failed gate (which means
the code is broken, not the environment).
_Avoid_: build-failed, setup-error, broken.
