# WAR — Context

The ubiquitous language of WAR (Work · Audit · Refine), a Claude-native orchestration of
worker/auditor/refiner agents over git worktrees and GitHub issues. This file is a glossary
only — no implementation detail.

## Language

### Worktree provisioning

**Provisioning**:
The owned lifecycle of the git topology a WAR run executes in: cutting the integration branch,
creating each task's worktree on the correct base, scoping it, reusing it for fixes, and tearing
it down (or preserving it on escalation).
_Avoid_: setup, bootstrapping, worktree management.

**Git-topology owner**:
The single role responsible for every mutation of *shared* git state — branches and worktree
directories. In WAR this is the refiner (the Refinery).
_Avoid_: provisioner (no separate role exists), branch manager.

**Container** / **Contents**:
The boundary between what the git-topology owner controls and what a worker controls. The
*container* is the branch and worktree directory (refiner-owned); the *contents* are the files
and commits inside a worktree (worker-owned). A worker never runs `git worktree add/remove` or
touches a shared branch; the refiner never edits task code.

**Task worktree**:
The one git worktree assigned to a single task, where its worker (and any later fix-worker)
implements that task. One per task, persisting until the task lands.
_Avoid_: checkout, sandbox, workspace.

**Integration branch**:
The per-phase branch (`integration/phase-N`) cut off the working branch, from which all of that
phase's task worktrees are created and into which approved tasks are merged. Removed after the
phase lands.
_Avoid_: feature branch, phase branch, staging branch.
